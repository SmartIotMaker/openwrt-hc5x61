#summary OpenWrt Firmware Building for HiWiFi Router (tw150v1)

= OpenWrt Firmware Building for HiWiFi Router (tw150v1) =

== Downloads ==
  * OpenWrt Firmware (2013-08-25): https://openwrt-hiwifi.googlecode.com/svn/downloads/openwrt-tw150v1-recovery-130825.bin  -- added tagged VLAN module and IPv6
  * Firmware TFTP utility package: https://openwrt-hiwifi.googlecode.com/svn/downloads/tftpd64.400-original.zip

== About HiWiFi ==
  A Chinese company developed a new OpenWrt based router named HiWiFi. This is a recently very popular "intelligent" router. It has very well-designed hardware, with good features as below and performance, and perfect for OpenWrt working with.

  * Features:
    * Atheros AR9331 SOC
    * 64MB RAM
    * 16M Flash
    * 8GB on-board USB Disk
  * Office Site: http://www.hiwifi.com/

  There is an IOS App in AppStore, which can be used to config and install plugin for the HiWiFi router: https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/ji-lu-you/id598232355?mt=8

== About this Project ==

  This project is for building a general OpenWrt firmware from source code for HiWiFi router. I've written a mach file to support this, and a few scripts to generate the firmware.

----

== Requirements ==
  * Ubuntu 12.04 is recommended, while untested for other Ubuntu versions.
  * Make sure the host has Internet connection.

== Building Steps ==
  # Checkout our scripts and source code:
{{{
svn checkout https://openwrt-hiwifi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk openwrt-hiwifi
}}}
  # Build:
{{{
cd openwrt-hiwifi
./build-openwrt.sh
}}}
  # Target HiWiFi recovery.bin image: *openwrt-tw150v1-recovery.bin*

== Firmware Flash How-to ==
  # Add a new IP on your PC's wired interface port: 192.168.1.88 / 255.255.255.0.
  # Extract the attached utility package (e.g., tftpd64.400.rar), and run tftpd32 for Win32 or tftpd64 for Win64, listening on the interface you set the IP to.
  # Replace the file 'recovery.bin' with 'openwrt-tw150v1-recovery.bin'.
  # Unplug the router's power cable.
  # Plug a cable from your PC to one of the router's LAN port.
  # Hold the RST botton with a needle or other sharp thing, and plug the power cable.
  # Keep holding the button until you see the 'tftpd' server shows a client is connected.
  # Seeing the LEDs twinkling in rotation indicates the firmware is being flashed. DO NOT turn off the power until it finishes.
  # Ping 192.168.1.1 until it echoes (will take up 3-5 mins to complete).

== Check the Results ==
  * If cannot ping 192.168.1.1 for more than 5 mins, most probably the firmware is bad, please flash to HiWiFi's official firmware if you are unable to get serial console output.
  * I strongly recommend you to deploy a TTL console for watching the flashing progress.

== Target System Configuration ==
  * By default, the internal switch does not forward data between wired ports. Please refer to this to add an initial "switch" configuration: https://code.google.com/p/openwrt-hiwifi/wiki/OnboardSwitchConfig
  * For LED lights configuration, please refer to:

= 极路由OpenWrt固件生成 (HiWiFi - tw150v1) =

== 系统要求 ==
  * 建议使用 Ubuntu 12.04, 其它版本Ubuntu亦可, 但未测试过.
  * 确保您的有不受限的互联网连接.

== 生成步骤 ==
  # 下载本源码:
{{{
svn checkout https://openwrt-hiwifi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk openwrt-hiwifi
}}}
  # 编译生成:
{{{
cd openwrt-hiwifi
./build-openwrt.sh
}}}
  # 最终 HiWiFi recovery.bin 格式的映像: *openwrt-tw150v1-recovery.bin*

== 刷机方法 ==
  # 为你电脑的“本地连接”加一个IP: 192.168.1.88 / 255.255.255.0 
  # 解压刷机工具包（例如 tftpd64.400.rar）, 根据操作系统位数, 32位运行tftpd32, 64位运行tftpd64.
  # 用上面生成的 openwrt-tw150v1-recovery.bin 替换刷机包目录下的 recovery.bin .
  # 拔掉HiWiFi电源线.
  # 网线一头连HiWiFi的LAN口, 一头连电脑.
  # 用尖锐物按住HiWiFi背后的reset孔不松动, 同时给路由器接电.
  # 直到看到tftpd出现进度条, 松开.
  # 前面板的指示灯会轮流闪烁, 表明内部Flash正在擦写, 此时不要断电.
  # ping 192.168.1.1, 直到ping通, 刷机过程总共3-5分钟.

== 检查结果 ==
  * 若长时间（超过5分钟）ping不通192.168.1.1, 可能固件有错误, 若无法通过串口看到启动信息, 建议刷回HiWiFi官方固件.
  * 建议焊接TTL串口以查看刷机过程.

== 目标系统配置 ==
  * 默认情况下，芯片LAN口的交换芯片不启用转发，造成网口之间不通。请参考此处添加switch配置: https://code.google.com/p/openwrt-hiwifi/wiki/OnboardSwitchConfig
  * LED灯配置请参考上面英文说明的图片链接.
